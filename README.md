# End-to-End E-commerce Analytics Pipeline (AWS Ready)

This repository contains a complete, production-ready **e-commerce analytics pipeline**.  
It can run on **AWS services (S3, Glue, Redshift, QuickSight)** or locally with **MinIO + Postgres** for development.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Ingest raw e-commerce data (orders, customers, products).
- Store data in **AWS S3** (or MinIO locally).
- Transform and clean data using **AWS Glue** (or PySpark locally).
- Load curated data into **Redshift** (or Postgres locally).
- Analyze data with **QuickSight** or dashboards (e.g., Metabase locally).

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **AWS**: S3, Glue, Redshift, QuickSight  
- **Local Dev**: MinIO, Postgres, Docker  
- **Python & PySpark** for transformations  
- **Docker & docker-compose** for reproducibility
